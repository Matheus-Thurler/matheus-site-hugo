However, when it comes to managing project-specific dependencies and virtual environments, pip alone can feel a bit basic. Developers often find themselves juggling pip with virtualenv (or Python\u0026rsquo;s built-in venv module), manually creating environments, activating them via specific scripts, and managing requirements.txt files.\nThis is where Pipenv comes to the rescue! Pipenv is the \u0026ldquo;officially recommended Python packaging tool from Python.org\u0026rdquo;, designed to bring the best of all packaging worlds to the Python developer. It automatically creates and manages a virtual environment for your projects, and it manages your project dependencies in a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, offering a more robust and deterministic build process.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s dive into how you can use Pipenv to streamline your Python workflow.\nWhy Choose Pipenv? Integrated Virtual Environments: No more separate virtualenv or venv commands. Pipenv handles virtual environment creation and management automatically. Deterministic Builds: Pipfile.lock ensures that you get the same versions of dependencies every time, across different environments. Dependency Resolution: Pipenv helps resolve complex dependency graphs. Clear Separation of Dependencies: Pipfile distinguishes between default and development dependencies. Security: It can check for security vulnerabilities in your dependencies. Getting Started: Installing Pipenv First, you need to install Pipenv. You can do this using pip:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pip install pipenv Click to expand and view more It\u0026rsquo;s generally recommended to install Pipenv on a per-user basis using pip install --user pipenv to avoid potential conflicts with system packages, ensuring the user\u0026rsquo;s binary directory is in your PATH.\nInitializing Your Project with Pipenv Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your terminal and go to your existing project folder or create a new one:\nSHELL Collapse Copy mkdir my-python-project cd my-python-project Click to expand and view more Start Using Pipenv: You can initialize Pipenv in a project in a couple of ways:\nInstall a package: If you know what package you want to start with (e.g., requests), just install it. Pipenv will automatically create a Pipfile and a virtual environment. SHELL Collapse Copy pipenv install requests Click to expand and view more Activate the shell: If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to install a package yet but want to create the environment and Pipfile: SHELL Collapse Copy pipenv shell Click to expand and view more This command will create a virtual environment for your project (usually in a centralized location or a .venv folder within your project if PIPENV_VENV_IN_PROJECT is set) and activate it. (Image Alt: Terminal showing pipenv shell command creating a virtual environment and activating it, with Pipfile and Pipfile.lock appearing)\nUpon initialization, you\u0026rsquo;ll notice two new files in your project directory:\nPipfile: This file replaces the traditional requirements.txt and contains information about your project\u0026rsquo;s direct dependencies, Python version, and sources. Pipfile.lock: This file records the exact versions of all your project\u0026rsquo;s dependencies (and sub-dependencies). This ensures deterministic builds. You should commit both Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to version control. For those familiar with Node.js, Pipfile is analogous to package.json, and Pipfile.lock is similar to package-lock.json.\nManaging Dependencies Installing Packages To install a package and add it to your Pipfile, use pipenv install:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv install flask Click to expand and view more This will install Flask and add it to the [packages] section of your Pipfile and update Pipfile.lock.\n(Image Alt: Pipfile content showing Flask added under the [packages] section)\nInstalling Development Dependencies For packages only needed for development (e.g., linters, testing frameworks), use the --dev flag:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv install pytest --dev Click to expand and view more These will be added to the [dev-packages] section in your Pipfile.\nUninstalling Packages To remove a package:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv uninstall flask Click to expand and view more Updating Packages To update all packages:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv update Click to expand and view more To update a specific package:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv update \u0026lt;package_name\u0026gt; Click to expand and view more Viewing the Dependency Graph To see a tree of your project\u0026rsquo;s dependencies:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv graph Click to expand and view more Working with the Pipenv Environment Activating the Virtual Environment Shell As shown earlier, pipenv shell activates your project\u0026rsquo;s virtual environment. Your terminal prompt will usually change to indicate that you\u0026rsquo;re inside the virtual environment.\nRunning Commands Without Activating the Shell If you just want to run a single command using the project\u0026rsquo;s virtual environment without explicitly activating the shell, use pipenv run:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv run python my_script.py pipenv run pytest Click to expand and view more Exiting the Shell If you\u0026rsquo;ve activated the shell with pipenv shell, you can deactivate it by simply typing:\nSHELL Collapse Copy exit Click to expand and view more Collaboration and Deployment Generating requirements.txt (for legacy systems) While Pipenv uses Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, you might need a requirements.txt file for platforms or colleagues who don\u0026rsquo;t use Pipenv. You can generate one from your Pipfile.lock:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv lock -r \u0026gt; requirements.txt Click to expand and view more For development dependencies:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv lock -r -d \u0026gt; dev-requirements.txt Click to expand and view more Installing Dependencies from Pipfile.lock When someone else clones your project, or when you\u0026rsquo;re deploying, they can install all the exact dependencies specified in Pipfile.lock using:\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv sync Click to expand and view more This is the recommended command for production deployments as it ensures only the locked versions are installed. If you also need dev dependencies (e.g., in a CI environment for testing):\nSHELL Collapse Copy pipenv sync --dev Click to expand and view more Alternatively, pipenv install --ignore-pipfile also installs from the lock file.\nKey Advantages of Pipenv Summarized Unified Tool: Combines package management and virtual environment management. Reproducible Builds: Pipfile.lock ensures consistency across environments. Improved Security: Helps manage vulnerabilities and ensures dependency integrity. Ease of Use: More intuitive commands compared to juggling pip and virtualenv. Conclusion: Streamline Your Python Workflow Pipenv offers a significant improvement over traditional Python packaging workflows by providing a single, powerful tool for managing dependencies and virtual environments. By adopting Pipenv, you can make your development process smoother, more reliable, and easier to manage, especially when working in teams or deploying applications.\nGive it a try on your next Python project!\n","title":"How to Use pipenv"},{"link":"/posts/katex-and-mermaid-test/","text":"KaTeX and Mermaid Test This article is used to test the KaTeX and Mermaid features.\nConfiguration Frontmatter Configuration YAML Collapse Copy --- katex: true mermaid: true --- Click to expand and view more Global Configuration YAML Collapse Copy # hugo.yaml katex: enabled: true delimiters: - left: \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; right: \u0026#34;$$\u0026#34; display: true - left: \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; right: \u0026#34;$\u0026#34; display: false mermaid: enabled: true Click to expand and view more KaTeX Test Inline Formula This is an inline formula: $E = mc^2$, Einstein\u0026rsquo;s mass-energy equivalence formula.\nAnother example：When $a \\neq 0$, the solutions to the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are $x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$.\nBlock Formula Quadratic Formula $$x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$\nEuler\u0026rsquo;s Formula $$e^{i\\pi} + 1 = 0$$\nIntegral Formula $$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \\sqrt{\\pi}$$\nMatrix Representation $$\\begin{pmatrix} a \u0026amp; b \\\\ c \u0026amp; d \\end{pmatrix} \\begin{pmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{pmatrix} = \\begin{pmatrix} ax + by \\\\ cx + dy \\end{pmatrix}$$\nSummation Formula $$\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n^2} = \\frac{\\pi^2}{6}$$\nCommon Mathematical Symbols Test Using predefined macros: $\\RR$, $\\NN$, $\\ZZ$, $\\QQ$, $\\CC$\n","title":"KaTeX and Mermaid Test"},{"link":"/posts/image-rendering-test/","text":"Image Rendering Test The Demo comes from LightGallery All images are from Unsplash Single Image Photo by - Daniel Leone Justified Gallery Photo by - Tobias Rademacher Photo by - Massimiliano Morosinotto Photo by - Sascha Bosshard Photo by - Yusuf Evli Photo by - Jay Mantri Photo by - Florian van Duyn Photo by - Juan Davila Photo by - David Marcu Masonry by shortcodes ","title":"Image Rendering Test"},{"link":"/posts/code-highlighting-test/","text":"Code Highlighting Test This article is used to test the new code highlighting feature, including syntax highlighting, copy button, language display, etc.\nJavaScript JAVASCRIPT Collapse Copy function fibonacci(n) { if (n \u0026lt;= 1) return n; return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2); } const result = fibonacci(10); console.log(`The 10th Fibonacci number is: ${result}`); // Async/Await const asyncFunction = async () =\u0026gt; { try { const response = await fetch(\u0026#39;/api/data\u0026#39;); const data = await response.json(); return data; } catch (error) { console.error(\u0026#39;Error fetching data:\u0026#39;, error); } }; Click to expand and view more Codeblock with Line Numbers PYTHON Collapse Copy 1# Python with line numbers 2import asyncio 3from typing import List, Optional 4 5class DataProcessor: 6 def __init__(self, data: List[dict]): 7 self.data = data 8 9 def process(self) -\u0026gt; Optional[dict]: 10 \u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34;Process the data and return the result\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\u0026#34; 11 if not self.data: 12 return None 13 14 result = { 15 \u0026#39;total\u0026#39;: len(self.data), 16 \u0026#39;processed\u0026#39;: [] 17 } 18 19 for item in self.data: 20 if self.validate_item(item): 21 result[\u0026#39;processed\u0026#39;].append(item) 22 23 return result Click to expand and view more Highlighting Specific Lines GO Collapse Copy 1package main 2 3import \u0026#34;fmt\u0026#34; // This line will be highlighted 4 5func main() { 6 message := \u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34; // This line will also be highlighted 7 8 fmt.Println(message) // This line will also be highlighted 9 10 for i := 0; i \u0026lt; 3; i++ { 11 fmt.Printf(\u0026#34;Count: %d\\n\u0026#34;, i) 12 } 13} Click to expand and view more Codeblock with Filename api.ts Collapse Copy // TypeScript API interface ApiResponse\u0026lt;T\u0026gt; { data: T; status: number; message: string; } interface User { id: number; name: string; email: string; avatar?: string; } class ApiClient { private baseURL: string; private headers: Record\u0026lt;string, string\u0026gt;; constructor(baseURL: string, apiKey?: string) { this.baseURL = baseURL; this.headers = { \u0026#39;Content-Type\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;application/json\u0026#39;, ...(apiKey \u0026amp;\u0026amp; { \u0026#39;Authorization\u0026#39;: `Bearer ${apiKey}` }) }; } async get\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;(endpoint: string): Promise\u0026lt;ApiResponse\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;\u0026gt; { const response = await fetch(`${this.baseURL}${endpoint}`, { method: \u0026#39;GET\u0026#39;, headers: this.headers, }); if (!response.ok) { throw new Error(`HTTP error!
